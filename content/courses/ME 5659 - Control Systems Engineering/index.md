Covers concepts in design and control of dynamical systems. Topics include review of continuous-time system modeling and dynamic response; principles of feedback, classical and modern control analyses, and design techniques such as root locus, frequency response (e.g., Bode plots and Nyquist Criteria), and state-space feedback; dynamic analysis, design, and control of electromechanical systems; block diagram algebra or signal-flow graphs, effects of poles and zeros on system response characteristics; principles of controllability, observability, observer designs, and pole placement techniques; introduction to adaptive and learning control and digital implementation of control algorithms.
