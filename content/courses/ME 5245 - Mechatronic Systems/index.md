Covers kinematics and dynamics of robot manipulators, including the development of kinematics equations of manipulators, the inverse kinematics problem, and motion trajectories. Employs Lagrangian mechanics to cover dynamics of manipulators for the purpose of control. Covers control and programming of robots, steady state errors, calculations of servoparameters, robot vision systems and algorithms, as well as imaging techniques and the concept of mobile robots.
