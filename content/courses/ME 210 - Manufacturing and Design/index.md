This course introduces techniques in computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacturing as applied to mechanical components and systems. Manufacturing processes, their underlying physical phenomena, and their relevance to mechanical design are studied. Laboratory work includes the drawing and construction of a pre-designed mechanical system using CAD, conventional fabrication techniques, and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). All course topics are applied to the design, construction, and competition of a major group project.
