A study of the basic principles and modes of operation of automatic control systems, including the concepts and design of feedback control systems. The effect of closed-loop classical control on the transient response, error, stability, and frequency response of dynamic systems is introduced, as well as digital control theory. Laboratory work includes the use of programmable logic controllers to implement Boolean logic and the analytical and experimental study of closed-loop control systems implemented using operational amplifiers, as well as DC motors, stepper motors, transistor-based motor drive circuits, and AC circuits.
