abstract: Motorcycles, bicycles, and other single-track vehicles are popular but dangerous
  methods of transportation. While some are piloted by only a single rider, many powered
  two-wheelers are ridden with a passenger, who may also significantly influence the
  vehicle's dynamics. Because simulations are a critical component of vehicle safety
  research, this paper asks whether a simulated, active “virtual passenger” has stabilizing
  or destabilizing effects on a rider-vehicle-passenger system. This virtual passenger
  exerts its control effort by moving an inverted pendulum to simulate the motion
  of a human passenger's torso without explicit knowledge of rider inputs. A battery
  of simulations in the nonlinear, multi-body Webots robot simulator show that the
  passenger's control efforts have mixed effects on both rider effort and vehicle
  stability over abrupt transitions in pavement height. This indicates that the inclusion
  of passenger motion may be critical when vetting the safety of roadway designs and/or
  emerging motorcycle technologies like Advanced Rider Assist Systems.
