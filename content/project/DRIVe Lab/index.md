My junior year at Lafayette College, I had the opportunity to work with a small team of researches to develop an autonomous electric mini-motorcycle that used torque about the steering axis to self-stabilize and follow simple paths. My contributions included:
- Designing the steering motor mount for manufacturing
- Programming the steering Arduino FSM
- Designing and soldered the steering interface circuit board
- Designing and wiring the tractive and control systems
- Designing multiple safety systems and failsafes in the mechanical and electrical systems
