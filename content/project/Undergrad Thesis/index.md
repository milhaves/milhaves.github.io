For my senior thesis at Lafayette College, I developed a robotic balancing system that used an inverted pendulum to simulate the torque input a rider applies on a motorcycle when leaning to stabilize on uneven terrain. In my thesis I:
- Conducted a literature review to familiarize myself with the state of research in the field
- Developed a LQR controller for the rider-lean inverted pendulum system
- Conducted linear and Webots simulations to validate the controller and system design parameters
- Designed and prototyped the balancer system on an electric motorcycle
