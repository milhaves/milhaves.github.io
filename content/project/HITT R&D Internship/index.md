This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern with the Robotics R&D team at HITT Contracting Inc. During my 10 weeks there, I worked on the Virtual Superintendent project, which used a Boston Dynamics Spot robot and custom payload of cameras and LiDAR sensors to allow off-site administrative personnel to investigate the site and respond to problems in real-time. My contribution was designing a custom payload that included a 6-DOF arm holding a tablet that moved through several vertical configurations to assist in human-friendly telecommunication in site.
